# Preliminaries

This is all intended to be sufficiently accessible that a curious, slightly nerdy teenager could stumble across it on an internet rabbit hole and be able to understand enough to tell their friends the main ideas. So I'm going to try and introduce most of the relevant symbols and jargon as we go. But here's a few just to start off.	

If you can't be bothered to read the whole thing, but find yourself stuck later on then try clicking on any of the words below that are confusing you the most:

- [Sets](sections:sets) 
- [Peano Axioms](sections:numbers)
- [Induction](sections:numbers:induction)
- [Groups](sections:algebra)
- [Partial order](sections:pre:order)
