# Symbols and Jargon

Glossary. Let me know what I've missed.
```{glossary}
$\land$
    Logical AND. $a \land b$ means $a$ is true AND $b$ is true

$\lor$
    Logical OR. $a \lor b$ means $a$ is true OR $b$ is true (or possibly both)

$\implies$
    Logical implication. $a \implies b$ means IF $a$ is true THEN $b$ is true (anything can happen if $a$ is false)

$\iff$
    If and only if. $a \iff b$ means $a \implies b \land b \implies a$, i.e. $a$ and $b$ are equivalent.

$\forall$
    *For all ...*
    For example, $\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, x < x + 1$ just says every $x$ is less than $x + 1$ (which is true)

$\exists$
    *There exists...*
    For example, $\exists x \in \mathbb{N}, x = x + 1$ just says there is some number $x$ such that $x = x + 1$ (which is false)

$\sum$
    The sum of the whatever comes after. For example $\sum_{i=1}^5 i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2$

$\prod$
    The product of whatever comes after. For example, $\prod_{i=1}^5 i^2 = 1^2 \times 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 4^2 \times 5^2$



Set
    Just a bunch of stuff written between $\{$ and $\}$. See [this section](sections:sets) for more info.

Function
    Mapping between sets, written $f: A \to B$. See [this section](sections:sets:functions) for more info.

Bijection
    A special type of function $f: A \to B$ in which pairs every element of $B$ with exactly one element of $A$.
